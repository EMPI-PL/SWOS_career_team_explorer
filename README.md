# Sensible Soccer career team browser

This is a simple and dirty Python script to extract squad info from ***CAR*** files for the purpose of getting details on TRIAL and RES players.
I'm not quite sure it's cheating. Let's just say you've got a very good scout in the team who gives you feedback on hot-prospects. :smile:

I've build this tool to have a quick access to squad details. Probably will improve it in future.
This tool may have some bugs. Any feedback is always appreciated.

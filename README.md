# Sensible Soccer career team browser

![picture](README_pic.png)

This is a simple and dirty Python app to extract squad info from ***CAR*** file for the purpose of getting details on TRIAL and RES players.
I'm not quite sure it's cheating. Let's just say you've got a very good scout in the team who gives you feedback on hot-prospects. :smile:

I've build this tool to have a quick access to squad details. Probably will improve it in future.
This tool may have some bugs. Any feedback is always appreciated.

### Requirements

* Python >=3.9
* Additional Python's libs: tkinter, pillow (PIL)
* *swos.ttf* font installed 

### Running

Just type in console (or from command line):

```
python gui.py
```

If your system is configured the proper way you may also want to double click on *gui.py* to execute the app.
